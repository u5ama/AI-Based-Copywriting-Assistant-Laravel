                                    <p>We will only use your personal data where we have a lawful basis to do so. How we use your personal data depends on why we have collected it:</p>
                                    <h3>3.1 Using data from your employer who uses Attio</h3>
                                    <p>If we have received your personal data because you are employed at a company that uses Attio as its CRM we will process your personal data to perform any contract we have entered into with your employer or in relation to any steps we take at the request of your employer prior to entering into a contract. Typically, this includes creating a user account for you so that you can access the Attio application.</p>
                                    <h3>3.2 Using data from connected Google Services</h3>
                                    <p>If we have received your personal data because you have chosen to <strong>Sign in with Google</strong> we will process your personal data to perform any contract we have entered into with your employer or in relation to any steps we take at the request of your employer prior to entering into a contract. In particular, this includes providing you with access to the Attio application.</p>
                                    <p>Attio is providing a customer relationship management (CRM) and task management application aimed at business customers. If we have received personal data because you have chosen to connect your Google Drive, Google Calendar and/or your Gmail account we will collect your data from this service in order to enhance the email, file and contact management experience and improve your productivity when using the Attio application. In particular, this includes access to your Google user data from within in the Attio application where you can view your data in the relevant context of a CRM software application and manage your professional relationships.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Additional Limits on Use of Your Google User Data:</strong></p>
                                    <p>Notwithstanding anything else in this Privacy Policy, if you provide us with access to data from connected Google services, our use of that data will be subject to these additional restrictions:</p>
                                    <ul role="list">
                                        <li>We will only use access to data from a connected Google Service to provide our Attio web and mobile CRM and task management application that allows users to read, process and write emails, access their Google Drive files and calendar. Furthermore, our use of data is limited to providing or improving user-facing features that are prominent in the requesting applicationâ€™s user interface.</li>
                                        <li>We will not transfer this data to others unless doing so is necessary to provide and improve features that are prominent in the user interface, comply with applicable law, or as part of a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets.</li>
                                        <li>We will never use Google User data for serving advertisements, including retargeting, personalized, or interest-based advertising.</li>
                                        <li>We will not allow humans to read this data unless we have your affirmative agreement for specific messages, doing so is necessary for security purposes such as investigating abuse, to comply with applicable law, or for our internal operations and even then only when the data have been aggregated and anonymized.</li>
                                        <li>Attioâ€™s use of information received, and Attioâ€™s transfer of information to any other app, from Google APIs will adhere to Googleâ€™s Limited Use Requirements.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <h3>3.3 Using data you uploaded or entered into the Attio application</h3>
                                    <p>If we have received your personal data because you uploaded it to our platform, we shall process that personal data for our legitimate interests and on your instructions.</p>
                                    <h3>3.4 Using data for our legitimate interests</h3>
                                    <p>We may also use your personal data for our legitimate interests, including dealing with any customer services you require, for regulatory and legal purposes (for example anti-money laundering and fraud prevention purposes), for audit purposes and to contact you about changes to this Privacy Policy.</p>
                                    <h3>3.5 Using data to provide Product Update E-Mails</h3>

                                    <p>Notwithstanding the above, you acknowledge that no system can be completely secure.
